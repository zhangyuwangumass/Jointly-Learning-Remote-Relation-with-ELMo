# Jointly-Learning-Remote-Relation-with-ELMo
This is the research project for CS682 Neural Networks.<br><br>

Relation extraction is a key NLP task, but it is highly constrained by long-distance dependency. In this work we are trying to incorporate the NAACL 2018 work ELMo Embedding https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365 with hierarchical attention architecture https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf to learn remote references in bio-medic documents. We also tried to jointly train the model on text generation and relation extraction tasks, which is related to both multi-task learning and transfer learning.
